* 6 cloves garlic, minced
* salt and black pepper
* 3 cup cooked and chilled rice (I prefer short-grain white rice)
* 6 green onions, thinly sliced
* 5–8 tablespoons soy sauce, or more to taste
* 4 teaspoon oyster sauce (optional)
* 1 teaspoon toasted sesame oil","1. Prepare rice. Either cook it, then spread it out on aluminum foil to dry out, or cook it the day before.
2. Heat 1/2 tablespoon of butter in a large sauté pan over medium-high heat until melted. Add egg, and cook until scrambled, stirring occasionally. Remove egg, and transfer to a separate plate.
3. Add an additional 1 tablespoon butter to the pan and heat until melted. Add carrots, onion, peas and garlic, and season with a generous pinch of salt and pepper. Sauté for about 5 minutes or until the onion and carrots are soft. 
4. Increase heat to high, add in the remaining 1 1/2 tablespoons of butter, and stir until melted. Immediately add the rice, green onions, soy sauce and oyster sauce (if using), and stir until combined. Continue sautéing for an additional 3 minutes to fry the rice, stirring occasionally.  (I like to let the rice rest for a bit between stirs so that it can crisp up on the bottom.)  
5. Then add in the eggs and stir to combine. Remove from heat, and stir in the sesame oil until combined.  Taste and season with extra soy sauce, if needed.
6. Serve immediately, or refrigerate in a sealed container for up to 3 days.",,https://www.gimmesomeoven.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/How-To-Make-Fried-Rice-Recipe-2-1.jpg,
Twice baked potatoes,,"* 8 baking potatoes, washed
* 3 tablespoons canola oil
* 2 sticks salted butter
* 1 cup bacon bits (fry your own!)
* 1 cup sour cream
* 1 cup Cheddar or Jack cheese (or a mix of both), plus more for topping
* 1 cup whole milk
* 2 teaspoons seasoned salt","1. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.
2. Place the potatoes on a baking sheet. Rub them with the canola oil and bake for 1 hour, making sure they're sufficiently cooked through.
3. Slice the butter into pats. Place in a large mixing bowl and add the bacon bits and sour cream. Remove the potatoes from the oven. Lower the heat to 350 degrees F.
4. With a sharp knife, cut each potato in half lengthwise. Scrape out the insides into the mixing bowl, being careful not to tear the shell. Leave a small rim of potato intact for support. Lay the hollowed out potato shells on a baking sheet.
5. Smash the potatoes into the butter, bacon and sour cream. Add the cheese, milk, seasoned salt, green onions and black pepper to taste and mix together well.
6. Fill the potato shells with the filling. I like to fill the shells so they look abundant and heaping. Top each potato with a little more grated cheese and pop 'em in the oven until the potato is warmed through, 15 to 20 minutes.",,https://food.fnr.sndimg.com/content/dam/images/food/fullset/2012/8/13/1/WU-0106_cheesy-baked-potatoes_s4x3.jpg.rend.hgtvcom.826.620.suffix/1382375911904.jpeg,
