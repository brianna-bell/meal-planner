# Fried Pickles

- Veggie or peanut oil
* 1/2 cup all purpose flour
* 1 tsp italian seasoning
* 1.5 tsp garlic powder
* 1/4 tsp salt
* 1/4 tsp pepper
* 1 TBS hot sauce
* 1/2 cup water
* 16 oz dill pickles, drained and dried on paper towels

1. Heat 1.5-2 inches oil in a heavy bottomed pot over medium-high heat to 375-degrees F.
2. In a shallow bowl or rimmed plate, whisk together flour, Italian seasoning, garlic powder, salt and pepper. Add hot sauce and water and mix until smooth.
3. Working in batches, add dried pickles to the batter, gently toss to coat. Using a slotted spoon (or Chinese Spider), remove pickles from the batter and let excess drip off. Gently add pickles to the oil one at a time. Fry for about 1 1/2-2 minutes or until golden. Remove and let drain on paper towels. Monitor oil temperature as batches are frying to maintain consistent 375-degrees F.
4. Serve with Comeback Sauce and/or ketchup.
