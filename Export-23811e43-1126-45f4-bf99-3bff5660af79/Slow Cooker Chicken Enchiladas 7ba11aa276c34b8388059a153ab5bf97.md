- [ ]  1 onion, chopped fine
- [ ]  ¼ cup veggie oil
- [ ]  3 tablespoons chili powder
- [ ]  3 garlic cloves, minced
- [ ]  2 teaspoons ground coriander
- [ ]  2 teaspoons ground cumin
- [ ]  1 (15-ounce) can tomato sauce
- [ ]  2 teaspoons sugar
- [ ]  1 pound boneless, skinless chicken thighs, trimmed
- [ ]  Salt and pepper
- [ ]  8 ounces Monterey Jack cheese, shredded (2 cups)
- [ ]  ½ cup minced fresh cilantro
- [ ]  ¼ cup jarred jalapeños, chopped
- [ ]  1 tablespoon lime juice
- [ ]  12 6-inch corn tortillas

1. Microwave onion, 2 tablespoons oil, chili powder, garlic, coriander, and cumin in bowl, stirring occasionally, until onions are softened, about 5 minutes; transfer to slow cooker. Stir in tomato sauce and sugar. Season chicken with pepper and nestle into slow cooker. Cover and cook until chicken is tender, 4 to 5 hours on low.
2. Transfer chicken to cutting board, let cool slightly, then shred into bite-size pieces using 2 forks. Combine chicken, ¾ cup sauce, 1½ cups Monterey Jack, cilantro, jalapeños, and lime juice in bowl. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
3. Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 450 degrees. Spread ¾ cup sauce over bottom of 13 by 9-inch baking dish. Brush both sides of tortillas with remaining 2 tablespoons oil. Stack tortillas, wrap in damp dish towel, and place on plate; microwave until warm and pliable, about 1 minute.
4. Working with 1 warm tortilla at a time, spread ⅓ cup chicken filling across center of tortilla. Roll tortilla tightly around filling and place seam side down in baking dish; arrange enchiladas in 2 columns across width of dish.
5. Pour remaining sauce over enchiladas to cover completely and sprinkle with remaining ½ cup Monterey Jack. Cover dish tightly with greased aluminum foil. Bake until enchiladas are heated through and cheese is melted, 15 to 20 minutes. Let cool for 5 minutes before serving.
