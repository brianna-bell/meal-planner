1. 

1. Preheat oven to 425. Wash and dry all produce. Cut potatoes into wedges. Toss with veggie oil, garlic powder, onion powder, paprika, salt and pepper (measure with your heart) and place on baking sheet. Peel 2-3 cloves garlic and wrap in aluminum foil and place on baking sheet. Roast on top rack, flipping potatoes halfway through until tender ~25 mins. 
2. In a large pan, melt butter. Add onions and salt, stir and let caramelize until medium to caramel brown.
3. Drizzle honey over caramelized onions, stir. Add whiskey, stir, and light with a long handled lighter to burn off.
4. When whiskey is burned off and most of the liquid has cooked off, remove from heat and set aside
5. In a big bowl, combine beef and garlic powder, onion powder, paprika (measure with your heart). 
Form into 4 equal balls (haha balls) and squish them until they're twice as large as a normal burger. Sprinkle some cheddar cheese in the middle of each one. Fold the sides of the burger over the cheese and smush them again to make regular size patties. Be careful not to make them too thick or they'll be a pain in the butt to cook.
6. Add patties to pan and cook to desired doneness. While patties cook, halve buns and toast until golden. 
7. Once garlic is done, open foil and mash clove with a fork until smooth. In a small bowl, combine mayonnaise, sour cream, and mashed garlic. Season with salt and pepper.
8. Spread buns with 2 tbsp ketchup and a thin layer of the white sauce. Put patties on buns and top with onions. Serve with potatoes.
