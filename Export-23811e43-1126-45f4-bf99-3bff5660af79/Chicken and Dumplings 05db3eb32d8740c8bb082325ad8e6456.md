# Chicken and Dumplings

- 1 large or 2 medium boneless chicken breasts
* 6 cups chicken broth
* 2 ribs of celery, broken in half
* 1/2 onion (chunk)
* salt & pepper to taste
* 3 cups all-purpose flour
* 1 Tbs baking powder
* 1 1/4 tsp salt
* 1 cup + 2 Tbs milk

1. Cut each chicken breast in half and place pieces in insert pot of Instant Pot.
2. Add chicken broth, celery, and onion.
3. Place lid onto Instant Pot and set vent to the sealed position.
4. Use the manual setting to select a 3 minute cook time at high pressure.
5. While chicken is cooking, prepare the dumplings by mixing flour, baking powder, salt, and milk until combined.
6. Turn onto a floured surface and roll to about 1/4 inch thickness (dough will be shaggy).
7. Use a pizza cutter to cut into strips about 1-2 inch strips or squares.
8. After the cook time has finished, perform a quick pressure release.
9. Once pressure has released and valve has dropped, carefully remove lid. Remove and discard chunks of onion and celery. Remove chicken to a plate.
10. Add dough strips to hot broth and stir well.
11. Use the Saute function to simmer the broth and dumplings. Simmer until dumplings are cooked and broth has begun to thicken, about 15-20 minutes.
12. (Broth will continue to thicken more as it cools, but you are welcome to add a slurry of cornstarch and water to thicken it even more if desired).
13. While the dumplings are cooking, shred the chicken and return it to the insert pot, stirring to combine.
14. Add salt and pepper to taste. Enjoy!
