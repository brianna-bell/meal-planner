# Spicy Maple Chicken

- Instant mashed potatoes
- 0.5 cup Panko Breadcrumbs
- 2 tbsp sour cream
- 4 tbsp maple syrup
- 2 chicken breasts
- Garlic powder
- Onion powder
- Paprika
- Chili flakes
- 2 tbsp butter
- Olive oil
- Veggie oil

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees. Pour maple syrup into a small bowl. Stir in a pinch of salt and chili flakes to taste. Set aside.
2. Place 1 tbsp butter in a second microwave-safe bowl. Microwave until melted, 30 seconds. Stir in panko, garlic powder, onion powder, paprika, 1 tbsp olive oil, and a big pinch of salt.
3. Pat chicken dry with paper towels; season all over with salt and pepper. Lightly oil a baking sheet and place chicken on one side. Evenly spread remaining sour cream onto tops of chicken; mound with panko mixture, pressing to adhere (no need to coat the undersides). Roast chicken on middle rack for 20-25 minutes.
4. Cook instant mashed potatoes.
5. Divide chicken and mashed potatoes between plates. Drizzle chicken with spicy maple syrup and sprinkle with more chili flakes if desired. Serve.
