# Breakfast sandwiches

- 1 tablespoon mayo
- 0.5 teaspoon hot sauce or sriracha
- 1 slice bacon cut in half crosswise
- 1 English muffin, split
- 0.5 teaspoon oil or unsalted butter
- 1 large egg
- Pinch table salt
- Pinch pepper
- 1 ounce sharp cheddar cheese, Monterey Jack, or American cheese, shredded (0.25 cup)
- 0.5 ounce (0.5 cup) baby spinach

Combine
 mayonnaise and hot sauce in bowl; set aside. Cook bacon in 8- or 
10-inch nonstick skillet over medium heat until fat begins to render, 
about 2 minutes. Flip bacon and cook until crispy, about 4 minutes, 
flipping as needed. Transfer to paper towelâ€“lined plate to drain.

Place
 muffin split side down in fat left in skillet (add 1 teaspoon oil if 
skillet looks dry). Cook over medium heat until muffin is golden brown, 
about 1 minute; transfer muffin to plate and wipe skillet clean with 
paper towel.

Heat
 oil in skillet over medium heat until shimmering. Meanwhile, crack egg 
into small bowl and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Once oil is 
shimmering, pour egg into skillet; cover and cook for 1 minute. Working 
quickly, top egg with bacon, cheddar, and spinach. Cover skillet, remove
 from heat, and let sit until cheddar is melted and spinach is wilted 
slightly, about 2 minutes.
