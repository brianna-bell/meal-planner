# Black Bean Quesadillas

- Long green pepper
- Black beans
- 4 small flour tortillas
- Shredded pepper jack cheese
- Sour cream
- 1 tbsp butter
- Veggie oil
- Tortilla chips
- Southwest spice

1. Wash and dry all produce. Halve, core, and thinly slice green pepper crosswise into strips. Melt butter in a medium pot over medium-high heat. Add black beans and their liquid, 2Â½ tsp Southwest Spice, and a large pinch of salt and pepper.
2. Bring beans to a boil, then reduce to a low simmer. Cook until thickened, 3-4 minutes. Turn off heat. Mash with a potato masher/fork until mostly smooth. Taste and season with salt and pepper.
3. While beans cook, heat a drizzle of oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. Add green pepper and season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring, until softened and lightly charred, 5-7 minutes. Turn off heat; transfer to a plate and set aside. Wipe out pan.
4. Place tortillas on a cutting board. Spread one half of each tortilla with a thin layer of mashed black beans and evenly top with green pepper and cheese. Fold tortillas in half to create quesadillas.
5. Heat a drizzle of oil in pan used for green pepper over medium heat. Add quesadillas and cook until tortillas are golden brown and cheese has melted, 3-4 minutes per side. 
6. While quesadillas cook, in a small bowl, combine sour cream and remaining Southwest Spice. Add water 1 tsp at a time until mixture reaches a drizzling consistency. Season with salt and pepper. Cut quesadillas into wedges. Serve with crema on the side.
