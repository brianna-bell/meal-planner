# Five Alarm Chili

- 2 ounces dried ancho chiles (4 to 6 chiles), stemmed, seeded, and flesh torn into 1-inch pieces
- 3.5 cups water
- 28-ounce can whole peeled tomatoes
- 0.75 cup crushed tortilla chips
- 0.25 cup canned chipotle chiles in adobo sauce plus 2 teaspoons adobe sauce
- 2 tablespoons veggie oil
- 2 pounds 85 percent lean ground beef
- Salt and pepper
- 2 pounds onions, chopped fine
- 2 jalapeño chiles, stemmed, seeds reserved, and minced
- 6 garlic cloves, minced
- 2 tablespoons ground cumin
- 2 tablespoons chili powder
- 1 tablespoon oregano
- 2 teaspoons ground coriander
- 2 teaspoons sugar
- 1 teaspoon cayenne pepper
- 1.5 cups beer
- 3 (15-ounce) cans pinto beans, rinsed

1. Combine anchos and 1½ cups water in bowl and microwave until softened, about 3 minutes. Drain and discard liquid. Process anchos, tomatoes and their juice, remaining 2 cups water, tortilla chips, chipotle, and adobo sauce in blender until smooth, about 1 minute; set aside.
2. Heat 2 teaspoons oil in Dutch oven over medium-high heat until just smoking. Add beef, 1 teaspoon salt, and ½ teaspoon pepper and cook, breaking up pieces with spoon, until all liquid has evaporated and meat begins to sizzle, 10 to 15 minutes. Drain in colander; set aside.
3. Heat remaining 4 teaspoons oil in now-empty Dutch oven over medium-high heat until simmering. Add onions and jalapeños and seeds and cook until onions are lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Stir in garlic, cumin, chili powder, oregano, coriander, sugar, and cayenne and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Pour in beer and bring to simmer. Stir in beans, reserved ancho-tomato mixture, and reserved cooked beef and bring to simmer. Cover, reduce heat to low, and cook, stirring occasionally, until thickened, 50 to 60 minutes. Season with salt to taste. Serve.
